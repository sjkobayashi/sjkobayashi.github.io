      Online privacy protection has gained momentum in recent years and spurred both government regulations and private-sector initiatives. A centerpiece of this movement is the removal of third-party cookies, which are widely employed to track online user behavior and implement targeted ads, from web browsers. Using banner ad auction data from Yahoo, we study the effect of a third-party cookie ban on the online advertising market. We first document stylized facts about the value of third-party cookies to advertisers. Adopting a structural approach to recover advertisers' valuations from their bids in these auctions, we simulate a few counterfactual scenarios to quantify the impact of Google's plan to phase out third-party cookies from Chrome, its market-leading browser. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that an outright ban would reduce publisher revenue by 54% and advertiser surplus by 40%. The introduction of alternative tracking technologies under Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative would recoup part of the loss. In either case, we find that big tech firms can leverage their informational advantage over their competitors and gain a larger surplus from the ban.

  - title: "Robust Estimation of Risk Preferences"
    authors: with <a href="https://www.aldolucia.com/">Aldo Lucia</a> (Caltech, his JMP)
    abstract: >
      Economic models estimated from experimental data have been questioned for their out-of-sample performance and relevance outside of lab settings. We investigate and address this issue by running a novel experiment and proposing a flexible model of non-Expected Utility behaviors. Our experiment examines two classical behaviors inconsistent with Expected Utility (EU): the common ratio effect and preferences for randomization. Unlike previous studies that tested these behaviors individually, our experiment considered them together, allowing us to observe their correlation within each subject. We document shortcomings of leading economic models, such as Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), in rationalizing both of these two behaviors. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel structural approach called the EU-Core model that enable us to predict behavior under risk without leaning on specific decision models. We further demonstrate that this method offers more accurate out-of-sample predictions about behaviors under risk than leading economic models and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we find that compared to CPT, the EU-Core model does also better in correlating within-experiment behaviors with outside-of-experiment behaviors, such as investing in traditional assets and cryptocurrency.
