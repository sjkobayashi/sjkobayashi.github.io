  - title: The Impact of Privacy Protection on Online Advertising Markets

    periodical: "EC '23: Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation"
    abstract: >
      Online privacy protection has gained momentum in recent years and spurred both government 
      regulations and private-sector initiatives. A centerpiece of this movement is the removal 
      of third-party cookies, which are widely employed to track online user behavior and implement 
      targeted ads, from web browsers. Using banner ad auction data from Yahoo, we study the effect 
      of a third-party cookie ban on the online advertising market. We first document stylized facts 
      about the value of third-party cookies to advertisers. Adopting a structural approach to recover 
      advertisers' valuations from their bids in these auctions, we simulate a few counterfactual 
      scenarios to quantify the impact of Google's plan to phase out third-party cookies from Chrome, 
      its market-leading browser. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that an outright ban would 
      reduce publisher revenue by 54% and advertiser surplus by 40%. The introduction of alternative 
      tracking technologies under Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative would recoup part of the loss. 
      In either case, we find that big tech firms can leverage their informational advantage over their 
      competitors and gain a larger surplus from the ban.

  - title: Buying Public Offices, Bureaucratic Diversity, and Economic Development
    authors: Ke Shi
    abstract: >
      I show that socioeconomic diversity in the government could contribute to the development of 
      private enterprises. I study the institution of selling public offices during late imperial 
      Qing and show that it had a positive impact on early industrialization in China. In 
      traditional Chinese society, merchants had relatively low social status and their businesses 
      were frequently subject to government extortion and appropriation. By taking advantage of 
      the office-selling program, the merchants were able to gain increased representation within 
      the imperial bureaucracy. This, in turn, had a positive spillover effect on the private 
      sector and early industrialization. I argue that changes in bureaucratic composition did 
      not necessarily enhance the institutional environment for businesses. Instead, a more 
      plausible mechanism is that purchasing officials had more progressive ideologies, preferences, 
      and relationships with business interests, ultimately reducing the occurrences of arbitrary 
      government interference and extortion.

  - title: "Venture Capital: A Tale of Three Networks"
    authors: Ke Shi
    abstract: >
      I present a structural estimation of the impact of venture capital (VC) networks on 
      performances, as measured by the proportion of successful portfolio exits. VCs face high 
      degrees of risk and uncertainty, and networks through coinvestments prove to be a solution 
      through the exchange and flow of information. Given this mechanism, I build a parsimonious 
      equilibrium model that bridges the gap between networks and performance with a micro-foundation. 
      To alleviate the endogeneity concerns in this model, I take two approaches. First, I 
      exploit exogenous variations in VC partners' past connections through professional and 
      alumni networks and adopt a Heckman procedure to correct for selection biases. Second, 
      I enrich the model with an endogenous network formation stage that allows VCs to optimally 
      choose their coinvestors. The latter approach also shines a light on the structure of 
      the unobserved, underlying social networks that operate in parallel to the coinvestment 
      networks. My results suggest that both networks have a significant and positive impact on 
      VC performances.

  - title: "Self-Control in Online Credit Markets"
    authors: Ke Shi, Yi Xin
    abstract: >
      We examine the impact of commitment devices in consumer credit markets, focusing on 
      a large peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform's introduction of a "direct-pay" disbursement option in 2018. This alternative 
      is designed to screen borrowers and mitigate self-control problems by transferring the 
      loaned amount to the borrower's creditors directly and reducing impulsive spending opportunities. 
      We find that direct-pay borrowers exhibited lower default rates compared to cash borrowers, 
      suggesting success in attracting responsible borrowers and addressing self-control problems. 
      We next develop and estimate a structural model to identify borrower type distributions 
      and consumption probability. Counterfactual simulations consider market scenarios with 
      no self-control issues and optimized discount menus for maximum welfare improvement.
