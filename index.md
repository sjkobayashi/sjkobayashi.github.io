I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Boston University's Questrom School of Business and an Affiliated Faculty member in the Economics Department. 

My research interests lie in **Empirical Industrial Organization** and **Quantitative Marketing**, with a focus on economic and privacy issues in online advertising and digital platforms. I use a combination of structural and causal inference methods to study these topics.
