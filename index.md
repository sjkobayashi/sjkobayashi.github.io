I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Boston University with research interests in **Quantitative Marketing**, **Empirical Industrial Organization**, and **Econometrics**. 

My main research agenda examines the effects of market mechanisms and information structures on firms' strategic behaviors, especially within digital markets. I have focused on the online advertising industry, which presents a rich landscape for my research due to its unique market mechanism and reliance on online data for advertising. 

I am also interested in analyzing consumer behavior by integrating economic experiments with structural econometric methods to account for deviations from classical economic models.
