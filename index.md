I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at California Institute of Technology with research interests in **Empirical Industrial Organization** and **Econometrics**. 

My main research agenda examines the effects on firms' strategic behaviors from market mechanisms and information structures, especially within digital markets. I have focused on the online advertising industry, which presents a rich landscape for my research due to its unique market mechanism and reliance on online data for advertising. 

I am also interested in analyzing consumer behavior by integrating economic experiments with structural econometric methods to account for deviations from classical economic models.

**I will be joining Boston University (Questrom) as an Assistant Professor of Marketing in Fall 2024.**
